# Capsone
Katie Hughes

My solution `code/capstone.py` combines milestones 1-3.

To run my solution, from the `Hughes_Katherine_capstone` directory run: 
`$ python3 code/capstone.py`
This will create an output file called `configs.csv` which will be located in the directory `Hughes_Katherine_capstone`. This file can be loaded into `Scene8_gripper.csv` in CoppeliaSim to play my simulated trajectory. It will also create `errors.csv` which is the vector $X_{err}$ at each timestep. The created image `errors.png` plots these errors over the course of the simulation.

All of my code is contained in `code/capstone.py`.
